# Jupyter Notebook analysing correlations in Movie Dataset
This python project done in jupyter notebook analyses correlations between variables in the movie dataset, and hopes to find out which variable is most closely related to gross box office or votes for cinema awards.

# Findings
Finding out what has the highest correlation with gross (money made from the movie).

Plotting budget against gross in a scatter plot.

Note that certain movie features (Director, Genre, Writer etc...) are text data, and can be numerized to allow for comparisons to check for correlation. 

Plotting a new Correlation Matrix with numerized columns.

Final correlation pairs of the data. Gross-Votes, Gross-Budgets have high correlations, but other features like Companies ultimately did not have a high correlation with Gross.
