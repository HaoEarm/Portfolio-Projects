# Bike Customer Dashboard
This project contains an excel dashboard on data based on customers interested in purchasing bikes.
Worksheets included in the file are the Raw Data Source, a modified worksheet that contains processed data, pivot tables and lastly an interactive dashboard.

This project intends to give a visual breakdown on customer profiles, and identify any noticable trends that can help to advise business decisions.

# Pivot Tables 
Using pivot tables, we are able to see where most of the customers are in terms of the various categories.

# Customer Data Findings
Firstly, average income of customers were around the range of $50,000 ~ $60,000, suggesting that majority of customers are Middle-Income.

Next, average commuting distances for customers who purchased bikes were on the lower end, (less than 5 miles), while Average commuting distances for customers who did not purchase bikes were on the higher end, (more than 5 miles). 
This seems to suggest that the current pool of customers ride shorter distances, perhaps for daily commuting and take more casual rides. Customers who are into biking longer distances for sport were not keen on purchasing bikes.

Lastly, we can take a look on the age demographic of the customers, where Adults are below 40 years old, Middle Aged are aged between 40 and 65, and Elderly are aged above 65.
We can see that most of the customers are Adults and Middle Aged.
